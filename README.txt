1. Since there are different classes for each type of bet we were able to get rid of the if else tree so that the code was more modular.
2. There are now 3 classes for bets when before there used to be one so there are more classes to keep track of.
3. You just have to write more classes and more code, but it ends up being cleaner.
4. I prefer the refactored code because it is cleaner and it is more readable.
